# Capstone
Capstone - Tour Planner Project

Our proposed capstone idea involves small music artists and an algorithm that can improve the efficiency of their musical tours.  Many smaller artists do not often have access to all the best resources in the music industry.  This project would help them get the resources they need to perform most successfully.  We are hoping to take datasets from music streaming apps and websites, such as Spotify and Apple Music.  Data from these apps and websites would be obtained via their web APIs.  We would then analyze these datasets using an algorithm to help artists find venues in areas where most of their fans are listening from.  Other factors that would help connect artists to specific venues include what music is typically played at each venue, what genre the band is, what bands have played there before, and cost to book the venue.  We are also hoping to help artists who have fans in the same area connect with each other.  These artists would then have the option to perform at the same venue on the same date to help maximize ticket sales and attendance.  The final product would be a tool that is available to any music artist who would like to plan a tour.
